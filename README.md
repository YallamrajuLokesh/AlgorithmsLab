# **MY ALGORITHMS LEARNING JOURNEY**

## **OVERVIEW**

This document summarizes my learning progress in algorithms, with a focus on key graph algorithms and optimization techniques. I have explored several fundamental algorithms that are widely used in computer science.

## **TOPICS COVERED**

### **1. Graph Algorithms**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: 
  - Explored the BFS algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
  - Implemented using a queue to keep track of nodes to visit.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: 
  - Learned about DFS for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
  - Implemented using recursion or a stack.

- **Topological Sorting**: 
  - Studied the concept of ordering the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). 
  - Implemented using DFS or Kahn's algorithm.

### **2. Minimum Spanning Tree**
- **Prim's Algorithm**: 
  - Learned how to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph. 
  - Implemented using a priority queue for efficient edge selection.

### **3. Dynamic Programming**
- **Knapsack Problem**: 
  - Explored the 0/1 Knapsack problem and its dynamic programming solution.
  - Learned how to optimize the selection of items to maximize value without exceeding weight capacity.

### **4. Shortest Path Algorithms**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: 
  - Studied Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
  - Implemented using a priority queue to efficiently select the next vertex to process.

## **FUTURE PLANS**

As I take a pause in my algorithms learning journey, I plan to revisit these algorithms, implement more complex variations, and explore additional topics such as A* search and graph optimization techniques.
